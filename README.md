# Angular Users Management

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly UI.
- **REST API Integration**: Fetches and manipulates user data from a mock API (`https://reqres.in`).
- **Pagination**: Includes pagination for user lists.

- **Dynamic Language Switching**: Allows users to switch between English and French dynamically.
